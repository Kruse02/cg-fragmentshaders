# CG Fragment Shaders
Fun with Fragment Shaders!
By Noah Kruse

Program overview:

This program is a website that I created that implements various different illumination techniques to create camera filters or image filters. It allows the user to choose between the filters of standard, black and white, fish eye, ripple, toonify, and a custom filter. Each of these fiters required a different manipulation of the image, shaders, and textures that are involved. The program allows for the user to use these filters on a precoded in video or they can use the webcam on their device. 

Program Instructions:

1. The proggram will open to a webpage of the video being played on the standard filter
2. The user can select if they would like to preview the video or to see the filters on their own webcam from their device
3. There are buttons that the user can select to view each of the different filters on the video or the webcam
4. There is a stop button that will pause the video in place to allow for the user to closer see how the filter works.

Program Conclusions:

I very much so enjoyed my Computer Graphics course because all of the assignments were to implement fun visuals such as this. I choose this one to show on my portfolio because I liked how I was able to implement something that we use in our everyday lives. Almost every application on our devices that uses the camera will feature the use of some filters and effects. Implementing these filters was far easier to do than I previously thought as the set up for the textures and shaders is very easy to manipulate. If I were to do this project again I would like to go into more depth on the filters and attempt to implement much more complex filters like facial recognition, object insertion, and much more. There are so many possiblilites to expand on this project and I would like to learn more about computer graphics. Computer graphics was one of my favorite classes that I took at St. Thomas because of how fun and useful it was.
